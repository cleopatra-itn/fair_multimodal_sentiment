Paper is available on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08829

## Data and Environment
- Available at https://mcrlab.net/research/mvsa-sentiment-analysis-on-multi-view-social-data/
- Download and extract images and texts into separate folders in `data/mvsa_single/` and `data/mvsa_multiple/`
- Create an environment using environment.yml with conda
## Splits
- 10 Fold Train/Val/Test splits provided in data/ for MVSA-single and MVSA-multiple.
- valid_pairlist.txt format is `file_id (filename), multimodal label, text label, image label`
- 0 (Neutral), 1 (Positive), 2 (Negative)
- Split file rows point to the line number in valid_pairlist.txt (0-indexed)
- `multimodal label` is used for training and evaluating all the models.

## Extract Features
- Download pretrained models to `pre_trained` from : [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_JcvA0-pfzkzmVgFTOc8LHUEhhzEvUG?usp=sharing)
- Download face expression features into `features` folder from : [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T_JcvA0-pfzkzmVgFTOc8LHUEhhzEvUG?usp=sharing)
- Extract image features: `python feature_extraction/extract_img_feats.py --vtype imagenet --mvsa single --ht False`
- Extract text features: `python feature_extraction/extract_txt_feats.py --btype robertabase --mvsa single --ht True`

## Train and evaluate models
- With one type of visual feature and BERT feature: `python train/multi_mlp_2mod.py --vtype clip --ttype clip --mvsa single --ht True --bs 32 --split 1`
